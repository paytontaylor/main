Hello, my name is Payton Taylor and I am currently in the beginning of my IT career. I am currently working in the Cyber Security field with my eyes set, in the future, on getting into DevOps particulary around the Cloud (AWS or Azure). I am currently working on building my own website using languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

I plan on following the MultiCloud Resume Challenge by Forrest Brazeal and build my homelab setup within different Cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. I do also, love working inside of Linux and want to make sure I implement the OS in my homelab anyway I can to learn and improve my setup. 

I am new to GitHub and plan on deep diving it as well to display an array of future projects
